### hello :wave: ben here :man_technologist:	:man_scientist:

I began programming daily during my PhD, using MATLAB to edit and build psychophysical experiments, statistically analyze and visualize data. I did a postdoc in which I continued using these skills for research, and generally improving productivity, automating data processing, and building interfaces for data. I began using Python regularly too. I am currently an analyst, collecting, cleaning, and analysing datasets. :chart: :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

What I have here are pieces of code I've written at work, which I think I'll reuse, and odd projects I've worked on for fun. :nerd_face:

My skills have increased the effectiveness and efficiency of my work enormously, and I find programming satisfying and fun! :+1:
