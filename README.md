### hello! ben here.

i got big into programming during my phd, where i used matlab to edit and then build psychoacoustic experiments, statistically analyse and visualise data. i did a postdoc in which i continued to use these skills regularly for similar tasks, and also built small software interfaces for non-programmer colleagues. i began using python much more regularly during this postdoc. i currently work as an analyst, where i use these technical skills to collect, clean and analyse data. 

i find programming very satisfying, rewarding and fun. while i'm still learning a lot (who isn't?), my skills have increased the effectiveness and efficiency of my work enormously.
