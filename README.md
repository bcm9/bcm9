### hello! ben here :wave:	

i got big into programming during my phd, where i used matlab to edit and build psychoacoustic experiments, statistically analyse data, and visualise data. i did a postdoc in which i continued to use these skills regularly for research tasks and as improving productivity, automating data processing and building software interfaces for non-programmer colleagues. i began using python much more regularly too. i currently work as an analyst, where i use my skills to collect, clean and analyse diverse datasets. :chart:	:bar_chart:	:chart_with_upwards_trend:	

i find programming satisfying, rewarding and fun. while i'm still learning a lot (who isn't?), my skills have increased the effectiveness and efficiency of my work enormously. :nerd_face:	:+1:
