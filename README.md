### hello! ben here :wave:	

i got big into programming during my phd, where i used matlab to edit and then build psychoacoustic experiments, statistically analyse and visualise data. i did a postdoc in which i continued to use these skills regularly for tasks, automating data processing and building software interfaces for non-programmer colleagues. i began using python much more regularly too. i currently work as an analyst, where i use these skills to collect, clean and analyse diverse datasets. :chart:	:bar_chart:	

i find programming satisfying, rewarding and actually quite fun. while i'm still learning a lot (who isn't?), my skills have increased the effectiveness and efficiency of my work enormously. :nerd_face:
