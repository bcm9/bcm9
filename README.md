### Hi, I'm Ben :man_technologist:	:man_scientist: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I began programming during my PhD, using MATLAB for experiments and analysing data. I did a postdoc, writing code regularly for the same tasks, and improving productivity with automation. I began using Python regularly and started exploring machine learning. I'm currently a research fellow, which of course involves collecting, cleaning, and analysing different types of data. What I have here are bits of code I've written at work, which I think I'll reuse, and odd projects.
