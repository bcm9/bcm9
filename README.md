### hello :wave: ben here :man_technologist:	:man_scientist:

I began programming daily during my PhD, using MATLAB to edit and build psychoacoustic experiments, statistically analyze data, and visualize data. I did a postdoc in which I continued to use these skills for research, improving productivity, automating data processing, and building interfaces for viewing data. I began using Python regularly too. I currently work as an analyst, where I collect, clean, and analyze diverse datasets. :chart: :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

What I have here are pieces of code I've written at work, which I think I'll reuse, and odd projects I've worked on for fun. :nerd_face:

I find programming satisfying, rewarding, and fun. While I'm still learning a lot (who isn't?), my skills have increased the effectiveness and efficiency of my work enormously. :+1:
