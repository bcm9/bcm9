### Hi, I'm Ben :man_technologist:	:man_scientist: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I began programming daily during my PhD, using MATLAB to edit and build experiments, statistically analyse and visualize data. I did a postdoc, in which I continued to write code regularly for research, and generally improving productivity through automation. I began using Python regularly too and started using machine learning techniques. I'm currently a research fellow, which of course involves collecting, cleaning, and analysing data. What I have here are pieces of code I've written at work, which I think I'll reuse, and odd projects I've worked on.
